# If not time, then what?
   Rather than counting seconds, which are so variable...
     Let's count the number of simple operatios the computer has to perform!

# Big O Definition:
  - We say that an algorithms is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases.
  * f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n) // as in a function the n grows so does the operations
  * f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) =n2)
  * f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1) //even if n changes the operations don't change
  * f(n) could be something entirely different
